# Potato Disease Classification

## Setup for Python:

1. Install Python ([Setup instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide))

2. Install Python packages

```
pip3 install -r training/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r api/requirements.txt
```

3. Install Tensorflow Serving ([Setup instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/setup))


environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  

## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `training/potato-disease-training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6. Run all the Cells one by one.
7. Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the `models` folder.

## Running the API

### Using FastAPI

1. Get inside `api` folder

```bash
cd api
```

2. Run the FastAPI Server using uvicorn

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

3. Your API is now running at `0.0.0.0:8000`

### Using FastAPI & TF Serve

1. Get inside `api` folder

```bash
cd api
```

2. Copy the `models.config.example` as `models.config` and update the paths in file.
3. Run the TF Serve (Update config file path below)

```bash
docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 -v C:/Code/potato-disease-classification:/potato-disease-classification tensorflow/serving --rest_api_port=8501 --model_config_file=/potato-disease-classification/models.config
```

4. Run the FastAPI Server using uvicorn
   For this you can directly run it from your main.py or main-tf-serving.py using pycharm run option (as shown in the video tutorial)
   OR you can run it from command prompt as shown below,

```bash
uvicorn main-tf-serving:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

5. Your API is now running at `0.0.0.0:8000`

Web Interface
To complete the project, add the HTML templates inside the templates folder at the project directory. Create two HTML files:

upload.html: This page allows users to upload an image.
predict.html: This page displays the prediction results after the user uploads an image and clicks the predict button.
Users can upload an image on the upload.html page, and upon clicking the predict button, they will be redirected to the predict.html page to view the results.
